I Love Square Number
Problem Statement

Consider a graph with $\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ vertices and $\frac{3N(N-1}{2}$ edges, where $N$ is an integer greater than or equals to 2.

The set of vertices is $\{(i,j) | 1 \leq i \leq N, 1 \leq j \leq i\}$.
There is an edge with weight $a_{i,j}$ between $(i,j)$ and $(i+1,j)$ (for $1 \leq i \leq N-1$ and $1 \leq j \leq i$).
There is an edge with weight $b_{i,j}$ between $(i,j)$ and $(i+1,j+1)$ (for $1 \leq i \leq N-1$ and $1 \leq j \leq i$).
There is an edge with weight $c_{i,j}$ between $(i,j)$ and $(i,j+1)$ (for $2 \leq i \leq N$ and $1 \leq j \leq i-1$).

For a simple path in this graph, the weight of the path is defined as the product of the weights of the edges that the path traverses.

Determine the number of unordered pairs of distinct vertices $\{s, t\}$ such that any simple path from $s$ to $t$ has a weight that is a square number.
